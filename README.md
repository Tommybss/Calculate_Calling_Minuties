# References for each .vb 
Each .vb was actually its own application. Since these are all smaller applications, I combined all of my code into this repo to save
time and space. Please see each category below to see what the code is doing.

  Arrays.vb - This code will allow the users to randomly generate or enter numbers using a text field. The user will then be able to find the high
and low range off all the values that were entered. The user can also sort and find the average of each array that is stored.

  BankCharges.vb - This code will let users enter a value to start with and then enter their charges as they occur. The application will then
take the numbers that were entered to calucate the users balance. 

  FenceCost.vb - This code will let users enter a number for a side of a fence. This application will assume the fence is sqaure and do
calculations accordingly.
  
  FenceCost_With_Two_Inputs.vb - This code will let users enter a number for the side (width and length) for a fence. This application will
assume the opposite side of the fence is = to the side you entered and do calucations accordingly.

  LongDistanceCalls.vb - This code will allow users to enter random number of minutes and do calucations based on the time of the day. 
  
  MakingChange.vb - This code will allow users to enter any $ amount value and it will make change based on calucations I created in the code. 
This change is relatvie and should always calucate based on the lowest $ amount. 

  RollingDice.vb - This code will simulate rolling dice
